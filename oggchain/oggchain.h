/* oggchain v0.1
     Hacked together by Kenneth Arnold <oggchain@arnoldnet.net>
   
   A simple tool to work with Ogg files as ordered archives. Currently
   only works with Vorbis (because that's all vorbisfile supports),
   but is designed with expandibility to all Ogg chained streams in
   mind.
