WHAT'S HERE:

This source distribution includes the vorbis tools and nothing else.  Other 
modules (eg, the modules vorbis, vorbis-tools and vorbis-plugins for the 
Vorbis codec) contain the codec libraries for use with Ogg bitstreams.

DIRECTORIES:

debian/		debian packaging stuff
include/	header files shared between the tools
intl/		GNU gettext library from gettext-0.10.40 (for i18n support)
ogg123/		an ogg vorbis commandline audio player

DEPENDENCIES:

All of the tools require libogg and libvorbis to be installed (along
with the header files).  Additionally, ogg123 requires libao, libcurl,
and a POSIX-compatible thread library.  The libraries libogg,
libvorbis, and libao are all available at
  http://www.vorbis.com/download.psp

The libcurl library is packaged with most Linux distributions.  The
source code can also be downloaded from:
  http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/

pre-built utilities may be found there.
