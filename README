WHAT'S HERE:

This source distribution includes the vorbis tools and nothing else.  Other 
modules (eg, the modules vorbis, vorbis-tools and vorbis-plugins for the 
Vorbis codec) contain the codec libraries for use with Ogg bitstreams.

Directory:

./oggenc  	the ogg vorbis encoder

./ogg123	an ogg vorbis commandline audio player

./vorbiscomment a comment editor

./debian	debian packaging stuff

CONTACT:

The Ogg Vorbis homepage is located at 'http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/'.
Up to date technical documents, contact information, source code and
pre-built utilities may be found there.

BUILDING FROM CVS:

./autogen.sh
make 

and as root if desired :

make install

This will install the Ogg libraries (static and shared) into
/usr/local/lib, includes into /usr/local/include and API manpages
(once we write some) into /usr/local/man.

BUILDING FROM TARBALL DISTRIBUTIONS:

./configure
make

and as root if desired :

make install

BUILDING RPMS:

RPMs may be built by:

after autogen.sh or configure

make dist
rpm -ta vorbis-tools-<version>.tar.gz
