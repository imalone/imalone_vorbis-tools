.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ogg123
reads Ogg Vorbis audio files and decodes them to the devices specified
on the command line.  By default,
.B ogg123
writes to the standard sound device, but output can be sent to any
number of devices.  Files can be read from the file system, or URLs
can be streamed via HTTP.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-b n, --buffer n"
Use a buffer of 'n' chunks (4096 bytes)
.IP "-d device, --device device"
Specify output device.  See
.B DEVICES
section for a list of devices.  Any number of devices may be specified.
.IP "-h, --help"
Show command help.
.IP "-k n, --skip n"
Skip the first 'n' seconds
.IP "-o option:value, --device-option option:value"
Assigns the option
.I option
to 
.I value
for the preceding device.  See
.B DEVICES
for a list of valid options for each device.  
.IP "-q, --quiet"
Quiet mode.  No messages are displayed.
.IP "-V, --version"
Display version information.
.IP "-v, --verbose"
Increase verbosity.
.IP "-z, --shuffle"
Play files in pseudo-random order.

.SH DEVICES

.B ogg123
supports a variety of audio output devices through libao.  Only those
devices supported by the target platform will be compiled in.

.IP null
Null driver.  All audio data is discarded.  (Note: Audio data is not
written to 
.B /dev/null
!)  You could use this driver to test raw decoding speed without
output overhead. 

.IP oss
Open Sound System driver for Linux and {Net,Free,Open}BSD.
.RS
Options:
.RS 
.IP dsp
DSP device for soundcard.  Defaults to  
.B /dev/dsp.
.RE
.RE

.IP alsa
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture.
.RS
Options:
.RS
.IP card
Sound card number.  (Default = 0)
.IP dev
Device number on the sound card.  (Default = 0)
.IP buf_size
Override the default buffer size (in bytes).
.RE
.RE

.IP esd
Enlightened Sound Daemon.
.RS
Options:
.RS
.IP host
The hostname where esd is running.  This can include a port number
after a colon, as in "whizbang.com:555".  (Default = localhost)
.RE
.RE

.IP solaris
Solaris audio driver.  Note that this driver has
.B not 
been tested!

.IP irix
IRIX audio driver.  Note that this driver has
.B not 
been tested!

.IP wav
WAV file output.  Writes the sound data to disk in uncompressed form.
If multiple files are played, all of them will be concatenated into
the same WAV file.
.RS
Options:
.RS
.IP file
Sets the output WAV file.  (Default = "output.wav")

.SH EXAMPLES

The
.B ogg123
command line is fairly flexible, perhaps confusingly so.  Here are
some sample command lines and an explanation of what they do.
.PP

Play on the default soundcard:
.RS
.B ogg123 test.ogg
.RE
.PP

Play using the OSS driver:
.RS
.B ogg123 -d oss test.ogg
.RE
.PP

Pass the "dsp" option to the OSS driver: 
.RS
.B ogg123 -d oss -o dsp:/dev/mydsp 
.RE
.PP

Use the ESD driver
.RS
.B ogg123 -d esd test.ogg
.RE
.PP

Use the WAV driver with the default output file, "output.wav":
.RS
.B ogg123 -d wav test.ogg
.RE
.PP

Listen to a file while you write it to a WAV file:
.RS
.B ogg123 -d oss -d wav -o file:test.wav test.ogg
.RE
.PP

Note that options apply to the device declared to the left:
.RS
.B ogg123 -d oss -o dsp:/dev/mydsp -d wav -o file:test2.wav test.ogg
.RE
.PP

Stress test your harddrive:
.RS
.B ogg123 -d oss -d wav -o file:1.wav -d wav -o file:2.wav -d wav -o file:3.wav -d wav -o file:4.wav -d wav -o file:5.wav  test.ogg
.RE
.PP

Create an echo effect with esd and a slow computer:
.RS
.B ogg123 -d esd -d esd test.ogg
.RE
.PP

.SH INTERRUPT
You can abort
.B ogg123
at any time by pressing Ctrl-C.  If you are playing multiple
files, this will stop the current file and begin playing the
next one.  If you want to abort playing immediately instead
of skipping to the next file, press Ctrl-C within the first
second of the playback of a new file.
.P
Note that the result of pressing Ctrl-C might not be audible
immediately, due to audio data buffering in the audio device.
This delay is system dependent, but it is usually not more
than one or two seconds.


.SH FILES

.TP
/etc/ogg123rc
Can be used to set the default output device for 
.B ogg123.
See the included file
.B ogg123rc-example
for an example.

.TP
~/.ogg123rc
Per-user config file to override the system wide output device settings.
.PP

.SH BUGS

The WAV driver does not interpret the file "-" as stdout. Note that
there are issues with streaming WAV-format audio, so there is no way
to fix this properly. Use the raw output driver if you need to use
ogg123 in a pipe.
